<h1>Stock App</h1>

The main objective of this project is to create a visualization of a stock's price over the course of one year.

In the Stock App, users will be able to:
1) input a publicly traded U.S. stock ticker name
2) view the daily closing price of that stock on a line graph over the last 52-week period
3) view the minimum price, maximum price, and the maximum possible profit in the 52-week range
4) hover over the line graph to view the daily stock price

In addition, this project will include:

1) a link to the line graph of the most recently searched stock ticker
2) README.md file
